# Project Tom

**Tom** is a friendly chatbot who helps you keep track of your **recurring tasks, events, and deadlines**.  
It saves your data in a file and loads them into an array of tasks whenever Tom is run.  

Tom allows you to:  
- **Mark or unmark tasks** (once done)  
- **Remove tasks** from the list  
- **Search tasks** either by **date/time** or by **keywords**

## How to Download Tom

1. Click on **Releases** in the repository.  
2. Download **ip1.jar** to get the Java program for Tom on your computer.  

> You may also download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` files to view source code,  
> but note that they will **NOT contain executable files**.  
> In that case, you would need to manually locate and run `Main.java`.
