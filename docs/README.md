## Saving Data to File
Joebot automatically saves your tasks to a file named `tasks.txt` in the
`data` directory when you exit the program using the `bye` command.
You do not need to manually save your tasks; they are saved automatically.
Do not unexpectedly exit the program (e.g., by closing the terminal window) as this may
prevent tasks from being saved properly.

## Loading Data from File
Joebot automatically loads your tasks from the `tasks.txt` file in the `data`
directory when you start the program.
If the file does not exist, Joebot will start with an empty task list.
You do not need to manually load your tasks; they are loaded automatically.

Now you have 8 tasks in the list.
