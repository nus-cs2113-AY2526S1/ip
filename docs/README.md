# Mimi User Guide

Mimi is a Personal Assistant Chatbot that helps a person to keep track of various tasks, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
The user can add tasks of three types to a task list: todo, deadline and event.
The tasks can be marked as done upon completion.

Some example commands you can try:

## Features
#### Notes about the command format:
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
