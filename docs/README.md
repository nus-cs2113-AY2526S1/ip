# Baraleous Personal Assistant User Guide

This is the project repository for Baraleous. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Using Baraleous

Baraleous is designed to be used to manage numerous commitments, both those with times attached, and those without.

Baraleous' memory persists between sessions, so you can set tasks, and restart Baraleous later and they'll remember.

All times are in natural language; Baraleous will not attempt to parse to any other format than the given string.

All indexes start from 1, not 0.
## User Interface
On startup Baraleous will greet the user with the following, promoting for a command.
```
  _________Baraleous__________
  Hello! I'm Baraleous XIV!
  What can I do for you today?
  ____________User____________
```
From there, the user can input any command under the ```____User____``` line, the result of which will be printed under a new ```___Baraleous___``` section.
This pattern will remain until program termination.
## Commands
Below are the list of commands, and their syntax and effects.

### task
