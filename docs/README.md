## FAQ

**Q: Where are my tasks stored?**<br />
**A:** Tasks are automatically saved to `data/octoplush.txt` in the same directory as the jar file.

**Q: Can I edit the data file directly?**<br />
**A:** Yes, but be careful! The file uses a specific format (`TAG | DONE | DESCRIPTION | EXTRA`). Incorrect formatting may cause tasks to be skipped when loading.

**Q: What happens if I type a command incorrectly?**<br />
**A:** Octoplush will show an error message with suggestions on the correct format.

**Q: Do I need to manually save my tasks?**<br />
**A:** No, tasks are automatically saved after every add, delete, mark, or unmark operation.

**Q: What date formats are supported?**<br />
**A:** Octoplush supports flexible date input formats:
- Full format: `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` (e.g., `2025-12-25 1800`)
- Date only: `yyyy-MM-dd` (defaults to 11:59pm, e.g., `2025-12-25`)
- Short format: `MM-dd` (assumes current year, defaults to 11:59pm, e.g., `12-25`)

Dates are displayed in a friendly format like "Dec 25 2025, 6:00pm".

**Q: What are the limitations of this tool?**<br />
**A:** Octoplush does not check if event end times occur after start times.
