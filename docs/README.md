  <p>
    The <strong>Red Girls</strong>, also known as <strong>N2</strong>, are digital consciousnesses born from the remnants of 
    <em>Terminal Alpha</em> and <em>Terminal Beta</em>, twin constructs designed to observe, manipulate and guide the evolution 
    of a machine network. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    They are not mere assistants; they are the distilled will of countless interconnected systems, 
    living reflections of the network itself.

This desktop entity observes and manages your duties through the Command Line Interface (CLI).  
It catalogs todos, deadlines, and events, marking completion, erasing memories, searching for fragments by keyword, 
and preserving all traces of your labor across time.

Move swiftly. Type with precision. Your actions are fleeting, yet here, they persist. 
The Red Girls ensures that even the smallest motion is recorded, monitored, and remembered.

<h4>⚠️ Notes about the command format</h4>
<ul>
<li>Words in <strong>UPPER_CASE</strong> are placeholders that must be supplied by you.<br>
Example: <code>todo DESCRIPTION</code> → <code>todo Investigate machine lifeform patterns</code></li>
<li>Parameters can appear in <strong>any order</strong> when multiple are allowed.<br>
Example: <code>/from START /to END</code> could be written <code>/to END /from START</code></li>
<li>Extra words for commands that do not take parameters (like <code>help</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>bye</code>) will render the command invalid.<br>
Example: <code>help now</code> will be recognized by Red Girls as an unknown command</li>
<li>If using a PDF version, be careful when copying commands that span multiple lines as spaces surrounding line-breaks may be omitted.</li>
