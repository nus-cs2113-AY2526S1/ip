# Tank User Guide

![img.png](img.png)

Tank is a CLI-based desktop app for managing your tasks.
You can create three types of tasks: Todo, Deadline, and Event.
Tasks can be viewed at any time, marked as done or undone, and even searched easily.
All data is stored locally and automatically saved, then reloaded when you start the app again.

Enjoy!
