![Anis Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muadzyamani/ip/refs/heads/master/docs/images/anis.png)

Anis is a friendly, command-line task management chatbot. It helps you keep track of **Todos, Deadlines, and Events**, mark and unmark them as done, delete tasks, list all tasks, and search for tasks by keyword. All your tasks are automatically saved to disk between sessions.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Ensure Java 17 or above is installed**  
   Run `java -version` in your terminal to check.

2. **Open the project in your IDE**  
   Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support.

3. **Run Anis**  
   Run the `anis.Anis` main class. You will see a welcome message and a prompt.

4. **Start using commands**  
   Type a command (e.g., `todo read book`) and press **Enter**.  
   Commands are **case-insensitive** and task indexes start at **1**.

## Features

- Commands are case-insensitive for the command word (e.g., `LIST` works), but arguments retain their case.
- Indexes in task lists are **1-based**.
- Anis automatically saves your tasks, so you don’t need to worry about losing data.

### List tasks: `list`

```

---

### Add an Event: `event <description> /from <yyyy-MM-dd> /to <yyyy-MM-dd>`
Adds a task that spans a period of time.

**Output:**
```markdown
Glad I could assist! Have a wonderful day.
Feel free to reach out anytime.
```

## Data Storage

- Tasks are saved in `data/anis.txt` automatically.
- Each task is stored on one line in a simple format:
  - `T` → Todo, `D` → Deadline, `E` → Event
  - `marked` is `1` if done, `0` if not
  - `additional info` is used for deadlines and events

- The file is updated automatically whenever you add, mark, unmark, or delete a task.
- You usually do **not** need to edit this file manually.

---

## Common User Errors

- **Empty description:**  `todo` → "The description of a todo cannot be empty."
- **Missing parts:**  `deadline return book` → "Please use the format: deadline <desc> /by yyyy-MM-dd"
- **Invalid index:**  `delete 200` → "Invalid task number."
- **Unknown command:** Any unrecognized command → "I'm sorry, I don't understand that command."
