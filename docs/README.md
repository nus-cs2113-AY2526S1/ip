# Jackson User Guide

**Jackson** is a desktop application for managing your tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, Jackson can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 17 in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `jackson.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/jyx0615/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Jackson task manager.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar jackson.jar` command to run the application.
5. Type the command in the terminal and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `list` and pressing Enter will show all your tasks.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features
> **Notes about the command format:**
> 
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> e.g. in `deadline /by DATE`, `DATE` is a parameter which can be used as `deadline /by 2025-01-01`.
> 
> - Items in square brackets are optional.
> e.g `DATE [TIME]` can be used as `2025-01-01 04:00` or as `2025-01-01`.
> 
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `bye`) will be ignored.
> e.g. if the command specifies `bye 123`, it will be interpreted as `bye`.
> 
> - If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

- Tasks are saved automatically after each command
- No manual save is required
- The data file uses a simple text format for easy backup and portability
- If the data file is corrupted, Jackson will show an error message on startup

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**  
A: Simply copy the `./data/jackson.txt` file to the same location on your new computer.

**Q: Can I edit the data file directly?**  
A: While possible, it is not recommended as incorrect formatting may cause Jackson to fail to load your tasks.

**Q: What happens if I enter an invalid date format?**  
A: Jackson will display an error message and ask you to enter the command again with the correct format.

**Q: Can I have tasks with the same description?**  
A: Yes, Jackson allows multiple tasks with identical descriptions.

## Known Issues

- Date parsing is strict and requires exact format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Time must be in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
- Very long task descriptions may cause display formatting issues
- The application does not support undo operations
