## Features

### Adding a Todo Task

Creates a simple task without any time constraints.

____________________________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] Buy groceries
Now you have 1 task in the list.

**Note:** You can omit the `todo` keyword - just typing the task description will create a todo task by default.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I add a simple task?**

A: You can add a todo task in two ways: `todo Buy groceries` or simply `Buy groceries`. The `todo` keyword is optional - just typing the description will create a todo task by default.

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

A: Copy the `data/tasks.txt` file to the same location on your new computer. Star Platinum will automatically load your tasks when you start the application.

**Q: What happens if I enter an invalid date format?**

A: Star Platinum will show a clear error message and guide you to use the correct `yyyy-MM-dd` format for dates.

**Q: Can I edit a task after creating it?**

A: Currently, you cannot edit existing tasks directly. You can delete the task and create a new one with the corrected information.

**Q: What if I enter a start date that is after the end date for an event?**

A: Star Platinum will prevent this and show an error message: "Invalid event dates! The start date cannot be after the end date."

**Q: Are my tasks automatically saved?**

A: Yes! Star Platinum automatically saves your tasks after every successful operation (except for listing tasks).

**Q: What if the application crashes?**

A: Don't worry! Your tasks are saved to `data/tasks.txt` after each operation, so you won't lose any data even if the application crashes.
