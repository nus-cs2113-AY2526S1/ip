dennis is a simple **command-line task manager** that helps you keep track of your to-dos, deadlines, and events. 

It allows you to add, list, search, mark, unmark, and delete tasks—all from your terminal.  

dennis saves your tasks automatically to a file, so your list is restored every time you run it.
