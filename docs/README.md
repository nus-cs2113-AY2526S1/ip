## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have the prerequisites in your system.
    - Java 17 or newer (JDK).
    - A terminal (Windows PowerShell/CMD) or an IDE (e.g., VS Code, intellij).
    - Mac users: Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)

2. Download/Clone (either method)
    - Download the latest `.jar` file from the latest release [here](https://github.com/Kurokishi592/ip/releases)
    OR
    - Clone this repo and enter the project directory:
        - `git clone https://github.com/Kurokishi592/ip.git`
        - `cd ip/ip`

3. Launch Kurokishi using either of these 3 methods:


| VSCode                                                                                                                                                                       | Intellij                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Terminal                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Open the project folder in VS Code.<br><br>- Open the file `src/main/java/kurokishi/Kurokishi.java`.<br><br>- Run the main method using “Run” or the code lens above main. | 1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:<br><br>   1. Click `Open`.<br><br>   2. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.<br><br>   3. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.<br><br>2. Locate the `src/main/java/kurokishi/Kurokishi.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Kurokishi.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). | Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar Kurokishi.jar command to run the application. |


> [TIP] 
> Tasks are saved automatically to `data/tasks.txt` in the `ip` folder.
> Every valid command will save the task immediately and automatically.

Witness the bootup of Kurokishi, which should display the following in your terminal:

## Saving Data

- Kurokishi automatically saves after changes (e.g., add, delete, mark/unmark).
- Save file location: `ip\data\tasks.txt` (relative to project root).
- Dates are stored in ISO format (e.g., `2025-10-15T18:00`).  
  Events may be stored either as separate fields or a single `from - to` field depending on version; both are recognized when loading.

Example file contents:
```
T | 0 | read book
D | 1 | return book | 2019-10-15T18:00
E | 0 | meeting | 2025-10-01T09:30 | 2025-10-01T17:30
E | 0 | trip | 2025-10-01T00:00 - 2025-10-05T00:00
```

> [NOTE] 
> `1` means done, `0` means not done.

---

## Editing Data Files

You can edit `data/tasks.txt` manually if needed.

- Keep the structure and separators exactly as shown:
  - Fields are separated by `|` (pipe) with optional spaces.
  - For events, either use two fields for start and end, or one field in the form `start - end`.
- Use valid ISO date-time (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`) or date-only (`yyyy-MM-dd`) values.
- Make a backup before editing.

Example valid edits:
```
D | 0 | file taxes | 2025-04-15T00:00
E | 1 | seminar | 2025-10-10T09:00 - 2025-10-10T12:00
```

> [WARNING] 
> Invalid lines may cause the app to skip tasks or show a “Corrupted data” error.
> You may need to fully clear the file for the program to work again.

---

## Archiving Data Files

To archive your current tasks:
1. Close the app.
2. Copy `ip\data\tasks.txt` to a safe location (e.g., `archive/tasks-2025-10-01.txt`).
3. To start fresh, delete `ip\data\tasks.txt` and run the app; a new file will be created automatically.

To restore an archive:
1. Replace `ip\data\tasks.txt` with your archived file while the app is not running.
2. Start the app.

---

## FAQ

- Q: What date/time formats are supported?  
  A: `yyyy-MM-dd` and `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` (e.g., `2019-10-15 0930`).

- Q: Why does my event show only a date and no time?  
  A: If you enter a date without time, it’s stored as 00:00 and shown as a date.

- Q: How do I reset all tasks?  
  A: Delete `ip\data\tasks.txt` while the app is closed. When you restart, the file is recreated.

- Q: I edited `tasks.txt` and now loading fails.  
  A: Check that all lines match the expected formats and that dates are valid.

- Q: Where does the app store data?  
  A: `ip\data\tasks.txt` relative to the project’s `ip` folder.

---

## Known Issues

- Exact spacing around markers is required for commands:
  - Use space before and after markers, e.g., `event x /from 2025-10-01 /to 2025-10-02` (note the spaces).
- Invalid dates (e.g., month `13`) will be rejected with an error.
- Very large data files may slow down “list” output in some terminals.
